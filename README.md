#  Sentiment Analysis using DistilBERT
This project implements a sentiment analysis pipeline using **DistilBERT** and Hugging Face Transformers. It classifies text into **negative**, **neutral**, or **positive** sentiments. The model is fine-tuned on a cleaned and balanced version of the [Kaggle Sentiment Analysis Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhi8923shriv/sentiment-analysis-dataset), and served via a Flask API.
